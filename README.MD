# eduframe-php-client

PHP Client for Eduframe V1

## Installation
This package is not puslished on packagist yet.

```
composer ..
```

## Usage
To access the api you need at least the Educator slug.

### Access token
Fetching published courses can be executed without an access token. 

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$connection = new \Eduframe\Connection();
$connection->setEducatorSlug( 'EDUCATOR' );
```
However when accessing invoices or users an access token is required. 
An access token can be obtained by requesting one via [Drieam support](mailto:support@drieam.com).

```
$connection->setAccessToken( 'ACCESS_TOKEN' );
```

### Normal actions
After you have set the educator for the request the data can be fetched as following:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$connection = new \Eduframe\Connection();
$connection->setEducatorSlug( 'EDUCATOR' );

// Set this in case you need an access token for your requests.
$connection->setAccessToken('ACCESSTOKEN');

// Set up a new Eduframe instance and inject the connection
$client = new Eduframe\Client( $connection );

// Example: Get courses
$courses = $client->courses()->all();

// Example: Get courses with includes in this case the course tabs
$courses_with_tabs = $client->courses()->all(['include' => 'course_tab_contents: :course_tab']);

// Example: Fetch list of planned courses with meetings
$planned_courses = $client->planned_courses()->all(['include' => 'meetings']);

// Example: Fetch a single planned course by id
$planned_course = $client->planned_courses()->find(123456789);
```
